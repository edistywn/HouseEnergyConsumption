# HouseEnergyConsumption

This project was inspired by one of public open data set in kaggle about reading result of temperature and humidity and sensor in a building. The data set itself not only contains result of sensor reading but also data from weather station and energy use in that building. In here I am trying to predict energy consumption with the sensor reading. In other words the goal of this project is predicting energy cosumption of a building by temperature, humidit and weather condition with machine learning algorithm. In this project I learn about feature selection and feature importance to select the most relevant fetures of data set for predicting energy consumption of the building. For the algorithms that I use in this project are linear regression and random forest regression with simple optimization on its parameter.
